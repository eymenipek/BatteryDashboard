# BatteryDashboard
BatteryDashboard aims to provide open source interactive plots from raw measurement data from the vehicle.
In this project, I will implement a Python based script to import raw measurement data from the vehicle (usually it is .mdf) or CSV/Excel. Then, the script will generate interactive html plots from this raw data.
Optionally, the script will provide a way to store this raw measurement data into MySQL database.
